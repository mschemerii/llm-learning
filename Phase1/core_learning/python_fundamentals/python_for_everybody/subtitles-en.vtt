00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.070
Hello, and welcome to Python for
everybody.

2
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.556
I'm your instructor, I'm Charles Severance
from the University of Michigan School of

3
00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:20.182
Information, and I've been teaching
this course for a long time.

4
00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:27.300
From the beginning, I set out to create
a different kind of programming class.

5
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.518
This is not intended to be
a first computer science class.

6
00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:34.409
This is intended to be
exposing you to the joy and

7
00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.540
happiness that I feel
when I write software.

8
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.260
I think software is wonderful.

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.210
I think it's creative, I think it's fun.

10
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.246
There's no prerequisites to this course.

11
00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.746
You don't have to know math to start it.

12
00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:52.178
I'm not in a hurry in this class.

13
00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:56.578
Most programming classes are stuck with 15
weeks and they got to teach you something.

14
00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:01.719
I'm going to teach you something I think
that you're going to love and feel joyful

15
00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.409
about and enjoy, and it's going to take
you as long as it's going to take.

16
00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.035
because really what I want to do is
prepare you to take your next programming

17
00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:15.402
course, not necessarily be
your first programming course.

18
00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:18.986
I want your first programming
course to be a successful one.

19
00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:23.298
And I want to teach you that which you're
going to be successful in your next

20
00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:23.850
course.

21
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.730
Even though I say it's easy and
you should take your time,

22
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.868
I understand that you
might find it frustrating.

23
00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:36.454
I'll tell you, I've been doing this for
a very long time,

24
00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:39.540
and if I'm working on something new or
different,

25
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.320
some new feature in a new language,
I can get just as frustrated as you.

26
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.446
The thing you got to learn about your
frustration when you're learning to

27
00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:52.850
program is it's not because it's hard,
it's because you don't get it yet.

28
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.766
And afterwards, you're like,
how was I confused about that?

29
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:04.920
This actually happened to me when I was
learning object orientation in PHP.

30
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.172
I probably was six to eight months that
I would look at the code and I'm like,

31
00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:10.762
what are they doing here?

32
00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:15.488
And I got ten languages that I know and
I couldn't look at it and I was getting so

33
00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:19.271
mad and I would spend like an hour
to read the documentation and

34
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.406
it didn't make any sense to me.

35
00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:25.134
And at one point,
just before I gave up, I looked at it.

36
00:02:25.134 --> 00:02:30.786
I'm like, their underlying model is very
similar to the Java underlying model.

37
00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:34.312
And then all of a sudden,
in an instance, everything changed.

38
00:02:34.312 --> 00:02:38.182
And I'm like,
how was I ever confused about that?

39
00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:42.968
And so for you, you're going to
feel that both sides of it,

40
00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:48.058
you're going to feel like I'm confused and
you're going to feel

41
00:02:48.058 --> 00:02:52.912
like a week later you're going to say,
I'm not confused.

42
00:02:52.912 --> 00:02:56.698
And why was I ever confused,
you're the same person.

43
00:02:56.698 --> 00:03:00.944
Last week you were confused,
this week you're fully understanding.

44
00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:03.740
That's how learning programming is.

45
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.846
If, for example, you get stuck and
you're frustrated, get some help.

46
00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:13.972
But my favorite strategy is to back up and
try again, this is not a race.

47
00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:16.078
You get many attempts at this.

48
00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:18.834
A student will be like,
I'm having trouble with chapter 5.

49
00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:22.981
And I'm like, how about you go back and
look at chapter 3 and then 4 and

50
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:24.418
then come back to 5?

51
00:03:24.418 --> 00:03:26.594
Because if you're having
trouble with chapter 5,

52
00:03:26.594 --> 00:03:28.978
that probably means you did
pretty good in chapter 3.

53
00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:32.694
So you go back and you're like,
this is easy, I know this stuff.

54
00:03:32.694 --> 00:03:34.134
And then you do three again.

55
00:03:34.134 --> 00:03:37.126
And then you go to four and like,
yeah, that's easy, I did this stuff.

56
00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:40.850
And then you go to 5, and
guess what, it's easy.

57
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.618
It was easy before, it's easy now.

58
00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:47.077
But now you're walking
in with a sense of like,

59
00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:50.767
I'm confident because you just finished
four and you're walking into 5,

60
00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:54.042
which you half know, but
now you're strong enough to know it.

61
00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:55.682
So mastering stuff and

62
00:03:55.682 --> 00:04:01.130
not necessarily trying to rush from
beginning to end is really important.

63
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.903
Another important part about
my commitment to teaching

64
00:04:06.903 --> 00:04:11.725
this course is that I don't just
want you to take this course,

65
00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:15.600
I want you to take this course, literally.

66
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.173
The materials in this course are free,
available under open-source and

67
00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:22.204
Creative Commons licenses.

68
00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:26.860
And you can literally,
if you're a teacher, take these materials.

69
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.649
People have translated these materials
into many languages because they're

70
00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:34.913
free and then teach their
courses in Greek or Polish or

71
00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:40.048
whatever language that they translate them
in because I give them the materials.

72
00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:44.537
There are over 400 classes around the
country at any given time that are using

73
00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:47.268
these same materials to
teach their courses.

74
00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:50.490
And so this is a real joyful thing for
me, right?

75
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.299
I put out a video a little while back for
this course, and

76
00:04:56.299 --> 00:05:00.179
I got a comment that said,
I was your student and

77
00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:03.730
now I'm a teacher and I love this course.

78
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.967
And then another person
went below that and said,

79
00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:10.652
I'm that person's student,
and now I'm a teacher.

80
00:05:10.652 --> 00:05:15.159
And I'm like, how lucky am I to have
built something that goes out and

81
00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.806
helps people's lives and
makes their lives better?

82
00:05:18.806 --> 00:05:21.540
And so
that's a big part of the free materials.

83
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.480
You may have to pay to get a certificate,
but the materials are always free.

84
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.343
So the name of this course is Python for

85
00:05:31.343 --> 00:05:37.880
Everybody with the word everybody
underlined and emphasized.

86
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.890
This course is teaching programming to
anyone, regardless of how old you are,

87
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.058
regardless how much prior experience
you are, regardless of how much

88
00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:55.660
money you have, regardless of any
disability that you may have.

89
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.198
This course is for you,
and it's for everybody.

90
00:06:02.198 --> 00:06:05.606
So welcome, I hope you enjoy the course.

91
00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:08.961
I hope someday I'll see you face
to face at one of my office hours,

92
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.230
which you'll sort of see
scattered throughout the course.

93
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.380
And again, good luck, and
welcome to the course.
